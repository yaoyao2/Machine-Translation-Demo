When I was in my 20s, I saw my very first psychotherapy client. 
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley. 
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex. 
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top, and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems. 
Now when I heard this, I was so relieved. 
My classmate got an arsonist for her first client. 
And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys. 
This I thought I could handle. 
But I didn't handle it. 
With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session, it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road.
